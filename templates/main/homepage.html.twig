{#
    {{ numberOfSomething }} This is used for printing whatever is in the double curly brackets as text. element inside is a twig element.

    {%  %} This is used for *doing something*, meaning it doesn't print anything, and is used for stuff like if and loop statements (if, for, foreach, while etc) or setting a variable
    What can be used inside of the procentBrackets can be found here -> {{ https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/ }}
    example of an if would be ->
    {% if numberOfSomething > 10 %}
        <p>some html to do</p>
